# LangGraphJS Agent Implementation for NestJS Chatbot

This directory contains comprehensive documentation and examples for implementing AI agents using LangGraphJS in your NestJS chatbot backend.

## Overview

LangGraphJS is a powerful TypeScript framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). This implementation guide shows how to integrate LangGraphJS agents into your existing NestJS architecture while maintaining best practices and leveraging your current patterns.

## üìö Documentation

### [Complete Implementation Guide](./LANGGRAPH_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md)

The main documentation file containing:
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Core concepts and architecture
- Integration patterns with NestJS
- Multi-agent systems
- Best practices and deployment considerations

## üöÄ Examples

### 1. [Basic Agent Example](./examples/basic-agent.example.ts)

Demonstrates how to implement a simple LangGraphJS agent that integrates with your existing NestJS services:

- **Features:**
  - Simple ReAct agent with tools
  - Integration with UserService
  - Conversation memory and history
  - Streaming responses
  - Health checks

- **Tools Included:**
  - User profile retrieval
  - Weather information
  - Conversation history management

### 2. [Multi-Agent System Example](./examples/multi-agent.example.ts)

Shows advanced multi-agent patterns including supervisor and network architectures:

- **Features:**
  - Supervisor pattern with specialized agents
  - Network pattern with direct agent communication
  - Agent handoffs and routing
  - Streaming multi-agent responses

- **Agents Included:**
  - User management specialist
  - Support specialist  
  - Analytics specialist

### 3. [Complete NestJS Integration](./examples/nestjs-integration.example.ts)

Full production-ready integration following all NestJS best practices:

- **Features:**
  - Complete module setup
  - Guards, interceptors, and middleware
  - Rate limiting and monitoring
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Metrics collection
  - Professional API endpoints

## üõ† Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core @langchain/openai @langchain/anthropic @langchain/community zod
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Add to your `.env.dev`:

```env
# AI Model Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=anthropic-your-key

# Agent Configuration
AGENT_MAX_ITERATIONS=10
AGENT_TIMEOUT=30000
AGENT_MEMORY_TTL=3600
```

### 3. Basic Implementation

```typescript
import { createReactAgent } from '@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt';
import { ChatOpenAI } from '@langchain/openai';
import { MemorySaver } from '@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint';

// Create a simple agent
const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: 'gpt-4o-mini' });
const checkpointer = new MemorySaver();

const agent = createReactAgent({
  llm,
  tools: [/* your tools */],
  checkpointer,
  prompt: 'You are a helpful assistant...'
});

// Use the agent
const response = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }]
}, {
  configurable: { thread_id: 'user-session-123' }
});
```

## üèó Architecture Patterns

### 1. **Simple Agent** (Recommended for starting)
- Single agent with tools
- Direct integration with existing services
- Perfect for basic conversational AI

### 2. **Multi-Agent Supervisor**
- Central supervisor routes to specialists
- Good for clear task separation
- Easy to audit and control

### 3. **Multi-Agent Network**
- Agents communicate directly
- Flexible and collaborative
- Best for complex workflows

## üîß Integration with Your Codebase

The examples show how to integrate with your existing:

- **User Management**: `UserService` integration for profile management
- **Authentication**: Using your existing `AuthGuard` and `@CurrentUser` decorator
- **Database**: Leveraging TypeORM and Redis for persistence
- **Configuration**: Using NestJS `ConfigService` for environment management
- **Logging**: Professional logging following your current patterns

## üéØ Key Features

### ‚úÖ Production Ready
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and security
- Metrics and monitoring
- Health checks
- Type safety with TypeScript

### ‚úÖ Scalable Architecture
- Modular design
- Support for multiple agent types
- Horizontal scaling considerations
- Memory management

### ‚úÖ Developer Experience
- Full TypeScript support
- Clear documentation
- Working examples
- Testing strategies

## üìä Monitoring and Metrics

The implementation includes:

- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, success rates
- **Usage Analytics**: Agent invocations, tool usage
- **Health Monitoring**: Agent availability, system status
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error logging and handling

## üö¶ Getting Started Workflow

1. **Start with Basic Agent**: Use the simple agent example to understand core concepts
2. **Add Tools**: Integrate with your existing services via tools
3. **Scale to Multi-Agent**: Implement supervisor or network patterns as needed
4. **Production Deploy**: Use the complete NestJS integration example

## ü§ù Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ
- Start simple and iterate
- Use existing NestJS patterns
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor performance and usage
- Test thoroughly

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- Don't bypass existing security measures
- Don't ignore rate limiting
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't neglect monitoring
- Don't over-engineer initially

## üîç Testing

The examples include testing strategies for:
- Unit testing agent services
- Integration testing with mocked dependencies
- Health check validation
- Performance testing

## üìà Performance Considerations

- **Memory Management**: Conversation history cleanup
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse
- **Caching**: Tool responses and frequently accessed data
- **Monitoring**: Track response times and success rates
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling patterns

## üõ° Security

- Authentication integration with existing guards
- Rate limiting per user
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure environment variable management
- Audit logging for agent interactions

## üöÄ Deployment

- Docker configuration updates
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health check endpoints
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Scaling considerations
