## Architecture Components

### Core Services
1. **StreamProducerService** - Handles token production to Redis streams
2. **StreamConsumerService** - Manages stream consumption and message delivery
3. **ConnectionManager** - Manages client connections and session mapping
4. **StreamProcessor** - Processes stream data through configurable pipelines
5. **StreamHealthMonitor** - Monitors system health and performance

### Data Flow
