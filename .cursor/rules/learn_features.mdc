We will discuss about how to implement feature in the current code base and gather the best practices for the feature. We will work in the folder ./feature_elaboration, create a subfolder and put all work in a markdown file in the subfolder.
Note that:
1) you should refer to the current tech stack in the codebase
2) the implementation guides and practices should be production-grade
