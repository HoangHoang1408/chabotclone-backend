We will discuss about how to implement feature in the current code base and gather the best practices for the feature. We will work in the folder ./feature_elaboration, create a subfolder and put all work in a markdown file in the subfolder.
Note that:
0) You should refer to the current tech stack in the codebase
1) You should carefully care first about the concepts and best practices to implement the feature and then the code
2) The implementation guides and practices should be production-grade
3) You should at least create a README.md file for general guides and then IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for detailed implementation
